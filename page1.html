            <h2>Role Playing Games (RPG)</h2>
            <p>
                My favorite games are role-playing games because you get a chance to immerse yourself in the fantasy world
                and be a character you created in a different world. You can build the character up as you like and go on
                adventures with friends.
            </p>

            <h2>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA)</h2>
            <p>
                I also like MOBA games because they do not take too much time per game. They are at most 30-45mins 5v5 games
                you level your character build them up and battle try to beat the other team to your objectives. The goal is clear
                and concise and you do it all over again when done.
            </p>

            <h2>Adventure Games</h2>
            <p>
                Lastly I enjoy playing adventure games because I get to go an an adventure following a story. I enjoy complete all
                the side quests before getting to the main quest which gives me a sense of accomplishment. It is also fun to see the
                character progression through the storyline.
